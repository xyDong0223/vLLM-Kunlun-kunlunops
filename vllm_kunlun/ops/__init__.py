"""Unified registration entry point for Kunlun-optimized operators.

This package initializer performs two kinds of registration when the vLLM
Kunlun plugin is loaded:

* It ensures that the ``torch.library`` module defining custom operators has
  been loaded.
* It imports Python modules containing ``CustomOp.register_oot`` decorators,
  adding Kunlun implementations to vLLM's out-of-tree (OOT) registry.

These imports have registration side effects; the imported module names are
only retained to satisfy unused-import checks. The initializer is kept small
because every ``vllm_kunlun.ops.<submodule>`` import executes it first. Adding
unrelated imports here could introduce circular dependencies and unnecessary
startup work, so only modules containing registration logic are imported.
"""

import sys

# The plugin startup path normally loads the registration module directly
# before importing this package. This fallback handles direct
# ``import vllm_kunlun.ops`` calls and ensures that custom operator schemas
# and implementations are available. The sys.modules check prevents them
# from being registered more than once.

# These imports execute the OOT registration decorators in each module,
# registering Kunlun implementations for fused MoE, LayerNorm, Linear,
# Rotary Embedding, and vocabulary-parallel Embedding. The aliases are
# intentionally private because this package exposes the registration
# results rather than the module objects themselves.
